After a lot of reading and thinking on the topic, I have selected [Tendermint](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html) as the consensus protocol for this project. Tendermint strikes a nice balance between the much more academic solutions to the Byzantine General's Problem and more modern Blockchain solutions which lack credibility.

I've also created a short video presentation which provides an overview of Tendermint and how it fits into the landscape of Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols. You can watch the video [here](https://vimeo.com/394829930).
